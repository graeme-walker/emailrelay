E-MailRelay
===========

Abstract
--------
E-MailRelay is a simple store-and-forward SMTP MTA, designed for standalone 
machines with an intermittent (dial-up) connection to the wider Internet.
In most situations the only configuration required is to specify the mail 
gateway address on the command line. 

C++ source code is available for Linux and Windows. Distribution is under 
the GNU General Public License.

Quick start
-----------
The "emailrelay" program can be run as an SMTP server daemon using the
command "emailrelay --as-server", and stored mail can be forwarded by
running the command "emailrelay --as-client <isp-mail-server>:smtp". 

The "--as-server" command is typically run automatically at boot time, 
using the boot scripts under "/etc/init.d" or "/sbin/init.d", while the 
"--as-client" command is normally put into pppd's "ip-up" script ("/etc/ppp/ip-up") 
in place of "sendmail -q".

The program requires a writeable spool directory to store e-mail messages.
The directory defaults to "/usr/local/var/spool/emailrelay", but it
can be changed by using the "--spool-dir" switch.

By default the server will try to listen on TCP port 25. If another SMTP
server is running then it will fail to start up, with a "cannot bind" error 
message. The port number can be changed by using the "--port" switch.

To test the program out without a full installation:
(1) run the server as "emailrelay --no-daemon --no-syslog --log --spool-dir ${HOME} --port 10001 &"
(2) reconfigure your e-mail client to use port 10001 rather than 25 ("smtp")
(3) send some test messages to addressees on the Internet
(4) connect to the Internet
(5) forward the stored messages using "emailrelay --spool-dir ${HOME} --as-client <your-isp-smtp-host>:smtp"
(6) clean up with "killall emailrelay ; rm ${HOME}/emailrelay.*"
